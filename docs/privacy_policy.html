INFORMATION REGISTERED BY TRALALERE

Name and address of the controller of data

The controller of data registered is TRALALERE, 4 rue de Braque 75003 Paris.
The Users's right to transparency and right to demand rectification or deletion

The User has the right to demand access to their own data, rectification of deficient personal data and deletion of unnecessary personal data.
 
Information submitted by the User

The information the User voluntarily provides TRALALERE  when they sign up as new customer or create an account (which may include your name, company, address and contact details such as your telephone number, shipping address, billing address, email address or fax number) will be used solely for the purposes of satisfying the agreement between the parties, unless otherwise agreed.

6.1.4  Non Personal Data
For purposes of this Privacy Policy, “non-personal data” means information that does not directly identify the User. Additionally, non-personal data refers to“aggregate” and “de-personalized” information, which is data TRALALERE collects about the use of Services, from which any personally identifiable data has been removed.
TRALALERE may use digital tools or third party analytical software to automatically collect and use certain non-personal data that does not directly enable TRALALERE to identify the User. The types of non-personal data TRALALERE may collect and use include, but are not limited to: (i) device properties, including, but not limited to IP address, Media Access Control (“MAC”) address and unique device identifier or other device identifier (“UDID”); (ii) device software platform and firmware; (iii) mobile phone carrier; (iv) geographical data such as zip code, area code and coarse location; (v) game progress, score and achievements; (vi) other non-personal data as reasonably required by TRALALERE to enhance the Services and other TRALALERE products and services.
TRALALERE may use and disclose to TRALALERE’s partners and contractors the collected non-personal data for purposes of analyzing usage of the Services, managing and providing the Services and to further develop the Services and other TRALALERE services and products.
The User recognizes and agrees that the analytics companies utilized by TRALALERE may combine the information collected with other information they have independently collected from other services or products relating to their activities. These companies collect and use information under their own privacy policies.

6.1.5 Use by children
TRALALERE collects limited personal information (first name and age) about minors (anyone under the age of 18 years old) through their Services, but only where the User, the minor’s parent or legal guardian, has provided that information to TRALALERE during the registration process. Such information is not shared with third parties and is only shared internally. A child’s usage information, such as scores from games and assessments is only shared in an aggregated anonymous manner and never in a way that could personally identify the minor. In the event that TRALALERE learns that they have collected personal information from a minor without parental consent, they will delete that information as quickly as possible. If the User believes that their child or a minor may have provided TRALALERE with personal information beyond what is requested when signing up for the Services, please contact the company at apps@tralalere.com.

Upon the termination of this Agreement, User will discontinue all use of the Software and/or Services, promptly destroy or have destroyed the Software and any copies thereof, and, upon request by TRALALERE, certify in writing to TRALALERE that such destruction has taken place.
