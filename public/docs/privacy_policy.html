Such information is not shared with third parties and is only shared internally. A child&rsquo;s usage information, such as scores from games and assessments is only shared in an aggregated anonymous manner and never in a way that could personally identify the minor. In the event that TRALALERE learns that they have collected personal information from a minor without parental consent, they will delete that information as quickly as possible.
